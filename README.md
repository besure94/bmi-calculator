## Description

This application presents a user with a definition of body mass index (BMI). They then view a chart which displays the five categories of BMI. Below that is a definition of obesity, followed by information that BMI should not be used as the sole indicator of a persons health due to several reasons. The user is then given instructions on how to use the calculator, and they can pick "Imperial System" or "Metric System" to begin. The user is then presented with another form, where they enter their height and weight, and can view their BMI below. Users can also reset the form and switch between each system of measurement.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Select the green "Code" button, and clone this repository to your desktop.
2. In your terminal, go to your project folder and run the command `$ npm install` to install node_modules.
3. Run the command `$ npm run build` to bundle together JS files.
4. Enter the command `$ npm run start` to start a live development server.
5. Enter the command `$ npm run lint` to check for errors.

## Known Bugs

Application is functioning as intended, although I would like to give the user an option to hide the "Imperial" and "Metric" system forms after selecting "Choose System", instead of having to refresh the page.
